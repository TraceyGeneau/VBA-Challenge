# Stock Market Analysis with VBA
<br/>

Welcome to my Stock Market Analysis project using VBA! 📈 This script is designed to loop through stock data, providing valuable insights into yearly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volumes. Whether you're seeking a moderate solution that identifies the "Greatest % increase," "Greatest % decrease," and "Greatest total volume" or aiming for the hard solution that enables the script to run on every worksheet (year) at once, this VBA script has you covered. Let's explore and analyze stock trends with efficiency and precision!

Instructions:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the Excel workbook containing the stock data.
Run the VBA script to obtain comprehensive insights into each stock's performance.
Feel free to reach out for any questions or improvements you'd like to contribute. Happy coding! 🚀📊
